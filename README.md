# holded-skill

`holded-skill` is an AI skill that operates Holded ERP through [`holdedcli`](https://github.com/jaumecornado/holdedcli).

It supports:

- Reading ERP data (contacts, invoices, products, CRM, projects, team, accounting)
- Updating ERP data through Holded API actions
- Safe execution with structured command output (`--json`)

## Safety Policy

This skill always asks for explicit user confirmation before any write operation (`POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`).

No write command should run without a clear affirmative confirmation from the user.
